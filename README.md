## [Koe](https://adroit-autumn-237308.web.app/) - a multi-language definition Japanese Dictionary

---

## ABOUT
Koe is a web-app that provides intemediate learners of Japanese an easy way to look up words in both Japanese and English at the same time.
## WHY
To truly understand the nuances of Japanese, is necessary to consult a Japanese-Japanese dictionary. 

Unfortunately, many intermediate learners get discouraged when they first start try to understand a dictionary entry in Japanese.

Koe aims to be a stepping stone for intermediate learners that want to start using Japanese-Japanese dictionaries, but who still need the definition in English to help them understand.
## HOW
Koe takes the definitions from two different APIs directly from the browser.

It is build in Vue and hosted with Firebase.
